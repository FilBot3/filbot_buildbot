# Buildbot for Filbot

## Overview

This repository is to help me get my Buildbot instance working and with
different types of workers and jobs. So far I'm experimenting with using Python
modules to "containerize" different parts of the code. The goal is to get this
configuration to work with a Docker Latent Worker, or Kubernetes Latent Worker
using my Kubernetes cluster, either locally or remotely.
